# Quiz Master ðŸŽ®âœ¨

Welcome to **Quiz Master**, a MERN stack-based application that lets users take a quiz of ten random tech-related questions to test their knowledge and improve their skills. This project enhances the existing application with robust testing using **Cypress** for both **component testing** and **end-to-end (E2E) testing**.

## Project Description

**Quiz Master** allows users to:
- Start a quiz with ten randomly selected tech questions.
- Answer questions and view their progress.
- See their final score upon completing the quiz.
- Restart the quiz to try again.

This project highlights the importance of **testing** in modern web applications to ensure reliability and robustness. Using Cypress, comprehensive tests validate the functionality of the applicationâ€™s components and end-to-end workflows.

## Features

- âœ… Start a tech quiz with randomized questions.
- âœ… Dynamic display of questions and answers.
- âœ… Automatic scoring system.
- âœ… Option to restart the quiz after completion.
- âœ… Robust testing with Cypress for component and E2E tests.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript), Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Testing**: Cypress

---

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hagustin/Quiz_master.git
   cd Quiz_master
```

2. **Install Dependencies and build dist folder**:
```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Add the required environment variables.

   **Note**: Ensure your MongoDB Compass is open and connected to the database specified in your `.env` file.

4. **Run the Application**:
```bash
   npm run start:dev
```

5. **Seed the Database**:
```bash
   npm run seed
```

5. **Run Cypress Tests**:
```bash
   npm run cypress
```

## Testing with Cypress

### Component Testing
- **Tested Component**: `Quiz`
- Verifies the quiz functionality in isolation:
  - Starting the quiz.
  - Displaying questions.
  - Answering questions.
  - Completing and restarting the quiz.

### End-to-End Testing
- Tests the full workflow of the application:
  - Starting the quiz.
  - Answering all questions.
  - Viewing the final score.
  - Restarting the quiz.
